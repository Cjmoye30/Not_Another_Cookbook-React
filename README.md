# Title: Not Another Cookbook

## Todo List:
- Create a recipe model which will have recipe name, description, ingredients, and measures. The ingredients and measures should always align with eachother with how the data will get pushed to the model on load
- Add avatar image to profile page, and have avatar image visible in top right corner of the site when a user is logged in.
- Add edit button the profile page, and use a modal to pull in the signup form which would be easy to use to edit.
