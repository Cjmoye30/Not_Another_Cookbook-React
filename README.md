# Title: Not Another Cookbook

## Left To Do:
- DONE - Add go back and go forward button to each of the components.
- Add some kind of effect to the images which are staged to be delted in the update recipe modal.
- Add in an image preview when images are being uploaded when creating a new user, creating a new recipe, updating a recipe, or updating a profile. The image is already uploaded once you click on it, so it should be pretty easy to display.
- Do some different styling for the users list - looks a little bland right now.
- Create an actual read-me, and convert this to a .md page called to-do which can be all of your development items. You can also hide it if you want.
- finish styling on create recipe page.
- add in a font to use for the rest of the site other than the headers and titles
- when updating a profile, update the token with the new avatar image whenever that changes.
- add loading buttons or something to prevent creating a recipe or profile without the image being fully uploaded
- Add bio on github.
- Add to resume and portfolio.

## Nice To Have / Future Developments:
- turn each of the profiles into links which takes you to an individuals page.
- a a profile page of a user on our site can be different than the dashboard of the user who is logged in.
