        <h2>What is the purpose of this application?</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>This is going to be one of my starting templates that I can pull up and immediately build a website from. Over time, it will begin to take more shape and bring in a lot of components that I like.</li>
        <li>I want to create my own template so that I know exactly what is in the code base, and it will be easier for me to understand rather than cloning a repo from someone who is more advanced than me.</li>
        <li>And lastly, this is also meant to keep my coding sharp as I search for jobs.</li>

        <hr />

        <li>Even more importantly, I want to implement some webkits -MaterialUI for react- and make sure I understand how to use them </li>
        <li>I want to practice uploading images like I wanted to with project 3</li>
        <li>Practice all of my react routing</li>
        <li>Practice creating and implementing components which are used on pages - a lot of these can be pulled from class examples.</li>

        <hr />
        
        <li>And lastly, I want to add in notes on each one of these pages for something noteworthy that I've implemented. All of the notes can either be comments in the code or screenshots on the webpage.</li>
        <li>API Calls! - Make sure you can do them with React. Refer to example 19 in the React folder</li>

        <li>Header - change to a burger icon to make it look sleek instead of typing out the menu</li>
        <li>Add in the avatar components from MaterialUI and have that in the top right of the page when a user is logged in.</li>

        </ul>
