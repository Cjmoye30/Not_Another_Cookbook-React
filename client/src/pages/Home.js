                Add in a list of all users 
                Add in bio/explanation of website 
                Add links for login/signup if nobody is logged in 
                Add avatar image to top right of screen 
                Move menu to left side of screen (like youtube) 
                Delete Recipe 
                Add bio field for user profiles - add it into the model just as a string 
                Add in inspiration links for each recipe - array of links to navigate to so I can refer back to what site I got the recipe from 
                Add notes section for each recipe. 

                Convert the recipe image list into a component and import that on the homepage and then the profile page - all of the code is the same excpet for a query - could possibly do that
