                TODO List:
                - Add bio field for user profiles - add it into the model just as a string 

                - Add in inspiration links for each recipe - array of links to navigate to so I can refer back to what site I got the recipe from 

                - Add notes section for each recipe. 

                - have a separate sections just for spices when creating the recipe? not too important

                - Convert the recipe image list into a component and import that on the homepage and then the profile page - all of the code is the same excpet for a query - could possibly do that.

                - Add up/down buttons on the create recipe page

                - increase the height of the instructions fields on create recipe page

                - figure out how to upload multiple images using multer - i think the destination would be the urlEndpoint?

                - Loading buttons?

                - Prevent the user from creating an account before their image is ready and loaded - otherwise an account will be created without an image.

                - add in default avatar selections like you did with project 3

                - Style
